TwitTP -- Twitter Trend Prediction
==================================

This project will include the code created during the duration of my [FURI][1]
project during the Spring of 2014 at Arizona State University. Over time, I
will update this README to cover the scope of the project/repository as it
evolves.

Intent
------

This repository will include code from my research into predicting trends on
Twitter. If successful, I will include code implementing algorithms to take
Twitter data (likely in the form of JSON data, but I may add some restrictions
to the data format for simplicity's sake) and a desired topic, and attempt to
predict whether that topic will appear in the "top trending" categories at
some point in the near future.

As time goes on, I will refine this vision to a more specific set of feature(s)
and capabilities.
